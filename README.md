# My dwm build

It's pretty hard to summarize all the changes, but here are the things added :
- Moving windows
- Tons of layout :
  - Dwindle (bspwm alike)
  - Spiral (Inversed bspwm)
  - Bottom Stack
  - Horizontal Bottom Stack
  - Gapless Grid
  - Tatami (Sounds funny, is kinda cute)
  - Column Layers
- My keybindings (dig in `config.def.h` to take a look: line 92)
- My rules (Same, line 31)
- Center floating windows
- Cycle layouts (using a bind)
- A tag bar indicator
- Fullscreen
- Layoutmenu, using `xmenu`
- Custom status using [`dwmblocks`](https://github.com/Luc-Saccoccio/dwmblocks)

## Installation

**Warning !** I don't recommend at all that you use my build, mainly because it's configured and patched to match my tastes.

I warned you.

Run `make`, then `make install`.
